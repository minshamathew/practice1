      <p>A warm hello to anyone who is reading this.During these very nerve wreaking times where there is a lot to worry about,
         i wanted to force myself to talk about something positive ,something to distract both myself and the reader from the
         present harsh reality.Before i get into the topic of what i actually wanted to talk about i quickly want to share a phrase my husband likes
         to say so very often when i am depressed or utterly worried and  i have found a soothing feeling everytime i hear it .It goes
         something along the lines of <strong>"this too shall pass".</strong> its just four words but such deep meaning and sometimes i have found myself
         pondering over the very same lines. These are tough times for sure but they too will not last forever.true !we donot know when this will end but
         it will ,someday .So cheer up! or force yourself to find happiness even in these difficult times.Do whatever it takes to keep yourself afloat .

     <br>
         with love,
         Minsha
